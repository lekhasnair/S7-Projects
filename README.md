# Project Title: Breast Cancer detection using Histopathology Images

**Abstract**: Breast cancer is caused by the abnormal and rapid growth of cells. The early detection of this cancer can help in having a better chance in curing at an early stage itself and can have much more effective and impactful treatment.Computer- aided technology can help predict whether the patient is having cancer or not at an early stage with maximum precision and accuracy and will be very useful in oncology field of medical science. In this project, we will be  using a deep learning model  to do feature extraction and then using an optimization algorithm for feature selection and followed by successful classification as benign or malignant tumour.

# Project Title: Graph based Cancer Classification of Histopathology Images.


**Abstract**: To address the problem of identifying overlapping communities in networks while considering node attributes as well as the topological structure of the network. Normal community detection algorithms assume non-overlapping communities and ignore the additional information provided by node attributes. However, in many real-world scenarios, such as social networks or biological systems, nodes can belong to multiple communities simultaneously. By considering and combining the information from node attributes and the network topology, this project aims to develop an algorithm that can effectively detect overlapping communities that align with both the connections between nodes and their shared attributes, allowing for a more accurate understanding of complex network structures. This problem is relevant as it has applications in various domains, including social network analysis, recommendation systems, and understanding complex systems, providing valuable insights into the relationships and interactions within the networks.

# Project Title: Deep Learning for Micro-expression Recognition


**Abstract**: The goal of the research is to investigate the use of Deep Learning (DL) methods for Micro-expression Recognition (MER). Micro-expressions are unconscious, minute facial movements that indicate concealed emotions. Due to their spontaneous and quick nature, the challenge is in accurately identifying and recognising these fleeting emotions, which makes data collection and interpretation challenging. The practical uses of MER in a number of areas, such as emotion analysis, deception detection, and human-computer interaction, make this issue relevant. The project's goal is to use DL developments to improve MER performance and create reliable systems for use in the field. Limited accessible datasets, the difficulty of recording and annotating Micro-expressions, and the necessity for MER technology to be used in an ethically acceptable manner.
