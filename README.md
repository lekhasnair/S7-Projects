# Project Title: Breast Cancer detection using Histopathology Images

**Abstract**: In social networks, users possess hierarchical user attributes that serve as self-descriptive 
information. Attribute inference plays a crucial role in social networks for user classifications 
and targeted recommendations. However, current approaches mainly focus on the flat 
inference problem, leading to significant inconsistencies in multi-level tasks. This project 
addresses this issue by proposing a solution i.e., Multi-level Inference model, that takes into 
account the semantic hierarchy of user attributes. By considering the hierarchical structure, this 
approach aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of attribute inference, enabling more 
consistent and effective user classifications and targeted recommendations on social platforms.
Attribute inference is relevant because it enables social platforms to improve user experiences, 
provide personalized services, optimize platform operations, and drive targeted advertising, 
ultimately enhancing the value and effectiveness of social network platforms

# Project Title: Overlapping Community Detection on Attributed Networks.


**Abstract**: To address the problem of identifying overlapping communities in networks while considering node attributes as well as the topological structure of the network. Normal community detection algorithms assume non-overlapping communities and ignore the additional information provided by node attributes. However, in many real-world scenarios, such as social networks or biological systems, nodes can belong to multiple communities simultaneously. By considering and combining the information from node attributes and the network topology, this project aims to develop an algorithm that can effectively detect overlapping communities that align with both the connections between nodes and their shared attributes, allowing for a more accurate understanding of complex network structures. This problem is relevant as it has applications in various domains, including social network analysis, recommendation systems, and understanding complex systems, providing valuable insights into the relationships and interactions within the networks.

# Project Title: Leader-Based Community Detection Algorithm in Attributed Networks


**Abstract**: The project aims to address the problem of community detection in attributed networks by developing a Leader-Based Community Detection Algorithm. Community detection refers to the task of identifying groups or communities of nodes within a network that exhibit strong interconnections. Attributed networks include additional information or attributes associated with nodes, which can provide valuable insights for community detection. The problem is relevant because accurately identifying communities in attributed networks can help in various domains such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and understanding complex relationships. The proposed algorithm will leverage the attributes and network structure to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of community detection in such networks.
