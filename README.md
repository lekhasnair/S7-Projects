# Project Title: Breast Cancer detection using Histopathology Images

**Abstract**: Breast cancer is caused by the abnormal and rapid growth of cells. The early detection of this cancer can help in having a better chance in curing at an early stage itself and can have much more effective and impactful treatment.Computer- aided technology can help predict whether the patient is having cancer or not at an early stage with maximum precision and accuracy and will be very useful in oncology field of medical science. In this project, we will be  using a deep learning model  to do feature extraction and then using an optimization algorithm for feature selection and followed by successful classification as benign or malignant tumour.

# Project Title: Graph based Cancer Classification of Histopathology Images.


**Abstract**: The project aims to address the inefficient classification of Breast Cancer (BC) from
histopathological images using Deep Learning techniques. Breast Cancer is a common and
deadly disease among women, and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment.
Histopathology provides comprehensive information, but existing methods suffer from
inefficient learning of networks, resulting in suboptimal accuracy. The motivation is to improve
Breast Cancer classification by leveraging Deep Neural Networks and Transfer Learning for
better performance and facilitating pathologists' work. Challenges include the large size of
Whole Slide Image which is in gigabytes, limited availability of the training datasets due to
privacy policy concern, high computational requirements, and cost. The project seeks to
overcome these challenges and enhance the accuracy of Breast Cancer diagnosis from
histopathological images.

# Project Title: Deep Learning for Micro-expression Recognition


**Abstract**: The goal of the research is to investigate the use of Deep Learning (DL) methods for Micro-expression Recognition (MER). Micro-expressions are unconscious, minute facial movements that indicate concealed emotions. Due to their spontaneous and quick nature, the challenge is in accurately identifying and recognising these fleeting emotions, which makes data collection and interpretation challenging. The practical uses of MER in a number of areas, such as emotion analysis, deception detection, and human-computer interaction, make this issue relevant. The project's goal is to use DL developments to improve MER performance and create reliable systems for use in the field. Limited accessible datasets, the difficulty of recording and annotating Micro-expressions, and the necessity for MER technology to be used in an ethically acceptable manner.
